# Defcon-response

  I watched the Defcon video referring to the use of infrared cameras to track people by scanning license plates and storing a database containing the locations of where each set of plates was seen. I was aware of current methods used to monitor the population, but this was a method I was not aware of. I particularly enjoyed the discussions on how to counter the measures.
